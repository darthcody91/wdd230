        <img src="images/Golda.jpg" alt="Golda" />
        <p>
          Golda is a 80 year old widow who lives in Preston. Her grandkids and
          great-grandkids visit her often becuase she has a big yard for them to
          play in. She likes to know the weather, to know what the kids are
          going to be able to do. She has a hardtime with the internet and
          technology in general. The newspaper price keeps increasing, it
          doesn't get delivered everyday, and it's outdated. Her daughter is
          trying to teach her how to be comfortable with the internet, and wants
          to find a better source for news and weather.

        <p>
          The brother of John Jacob, Jeb, is a potato farmer from Soda Springs.
          He spends his days tending to his precious potatoes, and loves to sell
          them locally becuase he is a big believer in small town business. He
          is having a hard time keeping up with getting ads into the newspaper
          and wants a better way of spreading word about his potatoes. He is in
          his 60's, and has experience with technology. Always gets the newest
          iPhone's so he can Facetime with the grandkids.
