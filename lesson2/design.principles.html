          White space or "Negative space" refers to the space between different
          elements such as images and text. While the color doesn't have to be a
          literal white color, on the Star Wars website, they do a great job
          using the empty space, as seen above. In fact, they designed the image
          to "bleed" into the white. This effect gives the user a sense of
          smoothness between the picture and text.

        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <h1>Hoonigan</h1>
        <a href="https://www.hoonigan.com/collections/ken-block"
          >hoonigan.com</a
        >
        <picture>
          <img
            class="cimage"
            src="images/visualh.png"
            alt="hoonigan dot com screenshot"
          />
        </picture>
        <p>
          There are many things that can define what visual hierarchy is.
          Typically, most people associate it with the size of elements...but
          color can also help them be more prominent. Many sites use a
          combination of both, especially those selling merchandise. As shown on
          the image, they do a great job using color and size to get the user's
          eye to move around. The "select options" is a big red box that stands
          out against the white background. The different weight of the typeface
          also plays a part in creating eye movement with visual hierarchy.

        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <h1>Xbox | Microsoft</h1>
        <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/all-games?xr=shellnav"
          >xbox.com</a
        >
        <picture>
          <img
            class="cimage"
            src="images/hickslaw.png"
            alt="xbox dot com screenshot"
          />
        </picture>
        <p>
          Hick's Law means that with more choices available, the time to make a
          decision increases. Picking between two things is much easier than a
          couple hundred. Using filters helps eliminate the choices. Like in the
          image above of the Xbox store, there are 2587 games to pick from.
          Impossible for a user to spend time and look through every single
          game...if not boring. By giving a filter and a method of sorting,
          users looking for a racing game can narrow it down from over 2000
          games to 170. Thus, making it easier for the user to find what they
          want, and ultimately making a purchase.
